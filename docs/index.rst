`SkyProj`: Sky Projections with matplotlib and PROJ
===================================================

`SkyProj` provides an astronomically oriented interface to plotting sky maps based on matplotlib_ and PROJ_.
The primary goal of `SkyProj` is to create publication quality projected visualizations of healsparse_ and HEALPix_ maps.
In addition, `SkyProj` can be an interactive tool that allows you to dynamically zoom in on healsparse_ maps showing the full resolution of the map.

The `SkyProj` package addresses multiple issues in the default healpy_ plotting routines:

1. healpy_ supports a limited set of sky projections (`cartview`, `mollview`, and `gnomview`)
2. healpy_ converts sparse HEALPix_ maps to full maps to plot; this is memory intensive for large nside.
3. healpy_ is best at plotting full-sky and not partial-sky maps.

The code is hosted in GitHub_.
Please use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/skyproj/issues>`_ to let us know about any problems or questions with the code.
The list of released versions of this package can be found `here <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/skyproj/releases>`_, with the main branch including the most recent (non-released) development.

The `SkyProj` code was written by Eli Rykoff based on work by Alex Drlica-Wagner, and matplotlib/projection integrations derived from the cartopy_ package.
This software was developed under the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) using LSST DESC resources.
